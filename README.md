# Morphological_erosion_dilation
Compuate,show and plot erosion/dilation

The goal of this assignment is to generate an OpenCV Jupyter Notebook to perform morphology operations: Erosion and Dilation<br />

1.Load image using function<br />
2.Record the execution time applied to the dataset<br />
Use the following structuring element: 5x5<br />
0	0	1	0	0<br />
0	0	1	1	0<br />
0	0	1	1	1<br />
0	0	1	1	0<br />
0	0	1	0	0<br />
3.plot result of erosion or dilation
4.plot the execution of different iterations
